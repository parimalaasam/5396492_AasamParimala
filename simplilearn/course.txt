Here i am providing brief intro about my course.
Simplilearn offers a free, self‑paced Git tutorial that takes about 3 hours to complete. It covers the fundamentals of Git—including its distributed version control architecture—as well as the essential commands like git init, git add, git commit, git status, git branch, git merge, git push, and git pull. The course also explains the distinctions between Git, GitHub, and GitLab, and demonstrates how to collaborate using remote repositories, branching, and merge conflict resolution. Upon finishing, participants receive a certificate of completion.
